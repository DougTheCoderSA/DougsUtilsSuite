Doug's Programming and DB Utilities

All the code in this project is provided to you under the license found in the License.txt file in the root of this project.

This is a rather random assortment of utilities that fall into 2 main categories:
1. Code generation
2. SQL Server schema comparison, query generation.

Right now there's not much to look at.

Quick note: Projects with names that begin with zz are experimental, used to test concepts before they are incorporated into
a proper project. They can be useful to refer to, since live code generally has much more error checking and handling
which can obfuscate the code which is acheiving something relatively simple.

Probably the most usable utility is CodeStencil, which lets you connect to a SQL server, 
select the database, table, and columns, and then generate code from a template that can repeat
for each selected column.

More info and documentation to follow - these are spare time projects, which happen to make my life easier when
coding or doing DB admin.

Long term I want to have a basic set of ETL tools in here, a fairly functional replacement for SSMS, etc.

Beyond that, who knows?
